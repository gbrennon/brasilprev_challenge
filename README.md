# BrasilPrev Monopoly Challenge

### Description

This is my Monopoly simulator app.

To run follow this steps:
- Activate the environment using `pipenv shell`
- Install deps `pipenv install`
- Run the runner `python run.py`
- Check the results

The modules player.py and property.py are tested using unittest but I couldn't have time to write tests for monopoly, so i just did XGH for this module.

Everything seems to be working fine.

Have fun!

Cya ;)
